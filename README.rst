CodeSelfStudy.com
=================

This is the CodeSelfStudy.com website rebuilt in Flask/Python. More info will be posted here soon.

Structure
---------

1. app -- contains all of the application code
2. docs -- contains any documentation that we generate
3. sandbox -- contains any code snippets and experiments that people want to share with the team, without adding that code to the actual application

Resources
---------

- `Flask Quickstart <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/quickstart/>`_ -- a quick overview to Flask.
- `Flask example <https://github.com/CodeSelfStudy/Asteroid-API-Example>`_ -- a quick example application in Flask.
- `Restructured Text Cheatsheet <https://github.com/ralsina/rst-cheatsheet/blob/master/rst-cheatsheet.rst>`_ -- This is a quick cheat sheet to help with formatting .rst documents.
